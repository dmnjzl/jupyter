# Machine Learning and Neural Network Model

Machine Learning and Neural Network Model has two versions: [html](./Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Network-Model.html) and ipynb.

Click the above html link or the file in down folder to view it directly.

ipynb version is provided for you to see how neural network model learns from [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data by running code cell in the file. However, the code requires python 3.7 and some additional pynum and pillow python libraries. Follow the steps below to install pillow and start jupyter notebook in Anaconda. pynum generally is automatically installed by Anaconda. If not, follow tthe steps about installing pillow below to install it. 

1. Open Anaconda.
2. Click Environments on the left list then select a environment. For example, base (root). Make sure the environment uses python 3.7.
3. In the right panel, select _installed_ then search _pillow_.
4. If _pillow_ is not installed, change to _Not insatlled_, then search and install _pillow_ package.
5. Click your environment, for example base (root), again and select _Open Terminal_ from the popup list.
6. In terminal window, go to your down folder and start jupyter notebook

> your down folder\> jupyter notebook

7. In Jupyter home tab in browser, click _Machine Learning and Neural Network Model.ipynb_ to open it.
